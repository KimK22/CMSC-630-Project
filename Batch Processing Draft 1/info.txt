Info: 

1) Saves all new images and histogram information in a structure. This makes it easier to look through later on, and easier to call for future functions.
2) Before running functions, convert all images to chosen color spectrum. This will be used in any future image processing instead of calling the original image file.
3) Added data performance measures:
      Displays total processing time and average time per image for each class per procedure.
      However, it does not save this time in a variable.
